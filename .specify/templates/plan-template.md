# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [e.g., library/cli/web-service/mobile-app/compiler/desktop-app or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Confirm the design preserves Hexagonal Architecture: core logic depends only
  on ports/domain types and infrastructure is isolated behind adapters.
- Identify all affected layers (Gherkin, Step Definitions, Business
  Interactions, POM, Tool-Agnostic Abstractions) and verify each dependency
  points downward only.
- Confirm Gherkin scenarios describe business behavior and outcomes rather than
  brittle UI copy, element labels, or exact navigation paths unless those are
  explicitly part of the requirement.
- List new or changed interfaces such as `IBrowser`, `IPage`, `IElement`,
  provider strategies, or driver registries; explain why no Playwright-specific
  types leak above Layer 5.
- Describe whether the feature requires Decorator, Strategy, Builder, Chain of
  Responsibility, or Singleton/Registry patterns and where each pattern lives.
- Document ExceptionManager behavior for this feature, including when healing,
  exploration, smart reruns, or hard failure apply.
- Confirm TypeScript strict mode remains satisfied with no `any` and typed
  generics for reusable action abstractions.
- Confirm every new or modified Page Object follows the Page Flow Pattern: scoped
  to a single page or component and returns the next-state Page Object from
  navigation methods. Verify no god-class aggregates interactions across pages.
- Confirm all new source code follows OOP principles: behavior is encapsulated in
  classes; no standalone multi-purpose utility functions outside designated
  utility or factory classes are introduced.
- Confirm async/await usage is minimized: every new async method is justified by
  a genuine I/O or timer boundary in the adapter; Layers 1–4 use synchronous
  APIs wherever the adapter permits.
- Confirm all new and modified source files include required documentation: every
  public class, interface, exported function, and non-trivial method carries a
  documentation comment stating its purpose and contract; every new layer or
  adapter directory includes a README describing its role and the contract it
  satisfies.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., Playwright type exposed above Layer 5] | [current need] | [why a port/adapter boundary could not satisfy it] |
| [e.g., Global registry introduced] | [specific problem] | [why dependency injection or explicit composition was insufficient] |
